#' Computes the Number of Non-Missing Data Points by Group
#'
#' This function computes the number of non-missing observations for samples,
#' based on a group designation, for every biomolecule in the dataset
#'
#' @param omicsData an optional object of one of the classes "pepData",
#'        "proData", "metabData",  "lipidData", or "nmrData", usually created by
#'        \code{\link{as.pepData}}, \code{\link{as.proData}},
#'        \code{\link{as.metabData}}, \code{\link{as.lipidData}}, or
#'        \code{\link{as.nmrData}}, respectively. Either omicsData or all of
#'        e_data, groupDF, cname_id, and samp_id must be provided.
#'
#' @return a list of length two. The first element giving the total number of
#'         possible samples for each group. The second element giving a
#'         data.frame with the first column giving the peptide and the second
#'         through kth columns giving the number of non-missing observations for
#'         each of the \code{k} groups.

  # BEWARE! DON'T UNCOMMENT!! Or uncomment and see what happens ;)
  # The check.names argument was commented out because it placed an "X" in front
  # of the column name if the column name was a number (even if the number was a
  # character string e.g., "1"). This lead to problems when running a summary on
  # the filtered data because the group names in the group_DF attribute did not
  # match the column names of the filter object. For example, if the group names
  # were "1", "2", and "3" the column names would be "X1", "X2", and "X3".
  # Because of this discrepancy the summary would incorrectly print that all
  # biomolecules would be filtered. NOTE: The explanation above is outdated
  # because Evan A Martin on 10/05/2021 changed how the nonmiss_totals data
  # frame is created and how the column names are updated. However, I am leaving
  # the explanation for future generations of pmartR coding slaves in hopes it
  # will help them through this trying time in their lives.

  # Rename the columns according to the edata_cname in omicsData and the names
  # in the group_DF attribute. The order of the names in group_dat will always
  # match the order of the columns in nonmiss_totals because they were
  # previously placed in the same order.
  names(nonmiss_totals) <- c(get_edata_cname(omicsData), unique(group_dat))


  return (list(group_sizes = tot_samps,
               nonmiss_totals = nonmiss_totals))
