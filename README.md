This R package provides functionality for quality control processing, statistical analysis and visualization of mass spectrometry (MS) omics data, in particular proteomic (either at the peptide or the protein level; isobaric labeled or unlabled), lipidomic, and metabolomic data. This includes data transformation, specification of groups that are to be compared against each other, filtering of feature and/or samples, data normalization, data summarization (correlation, PCA), and statistical comparisons of groups of interest (ANOVA and/or independence of missing data tests). Example data to be used with this packages can be found in [pmartRdata](https://github.com/pmartR/pmartRdata).


## Installation:

This package makes use of several packages hosted on BioConductor.  If you are encountering warnings about unavailable BioConductor packages such as `pcaMethods`, you may need to add them to `options("repos")`:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

options("repos" = BiocManager::repositories())
```

(**Recommended**) Install from CRAN:
```r
install.packages("pmartR")

# or 

BiocManager::install("pmartR")
```

If you are on Mac/Windows and have a recent R version, you can skip compilation by installing from binaries, see the [pmartR CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pmartR/index.html) for available binaries.

```r
install.packages("pmartR", type = "binary")

# or 

BiocManager::install("pmartR", type = "binary")
```


To install the latest *release*:
```r
devtools::install_github("pmartR/pmartR@*release")
```

To install a specific release, say v2.4.0:

```r
devtools::install_github("pmartR/pmartR@v2.4.0")
```

**(Not recommended, since these changes are likely still being tested)** You can also install the latest changes to master:

```r
devtools::install_github("pmartR/pmartR")
```

### Problems with rcppArmadillo and gfortran on mac

There is a problem that causes pmartR to fail compiling cpp code, which has something to do with rcppArmadillo and certain installations of gfortran.  See these posts that try to explain the issue:  [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64992467/mac-clang-installation-seems-to-override-gcc-install) [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29992066/rcpp-warning-directory-not-found-for-option-l-usr-local-cellar-gfortran-4-8/29993906#29993906) [3](https://forum.posit.co/t/setting-up-travis-ci-on-linux-with-an-r-package-that-uses-rcpparmadillo/53910/3).  The simplest solution if you are on Mac/Windows and have a recent R version is to install from pre-built binaries (see installation section).  If you cannot install from binaries, two solutions we have found are:

1.  Install gfortran from a recommended source (not homebrew): 
    - [This CRAN-approved resource for build tools on mac](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) lists two versions of gfortran and how to install them.
    - On Catalina 10.15.7 I downloaded and installed gfortran 8.2 from the link provided in [this blog post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/#google_vignette)  
2.  When using the homebrew gfortran installation, add the line **FLIBS = -L\`gfortran -print-file-name=libgfortran.dylib | xargs dirname\`** to ~/.R/Makevars (a plain text file with no extention)

### gfortran and Apple silicon (M1/M2 chips)

There are similarly issues with compilation in newer Mac chips.  We recommend to install gcc-13 from homebrew `brew install gcc` or the universal version from https://mac.r-project.org/tools/.  

Additionally, some users experience errors with `ld:  Assertion failed ...` as seen [here](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/737707).  One solution is to use the old linker by making sure gcc uses the flag `-ld64` [(Xcode docs)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15-release-notes#Linking).  To do this, you can edit `~/.R/Makevars` to include this flag, for example by appending it to LDFLAGS with +=:

```
# in ~/.R/Makevars
LDFLAGS+=-ld64
```

or specifying it in your compiler command:

```
# in ~/.R/Makevars
CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc -ld64
```
