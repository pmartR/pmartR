\title{Combine technical replicates of an omicsData object}
\usage{
combine_techreps(omicsData, combine_fn = NULL, bio_sample_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{omicsData}{an object of the class 'lipidData', 'metabData', 'pepData',
'proData', or 'nmrData', usually created by \code{\link{as.lipidData}},
\code{\link{as.metabData}}, \code{\link{as.pepData}},
\code{\link{as.proData}}, or \code{\link{as.nmrData}}, respectively.  The
parameter techrep_cnames must have been specified when creating this
object.}

\item{combine_fn}{a character string specifying the function used to
aggregate across technical replicates, currently only supports 'sum' and 
'mean'. Defaults to 'sum' for seqData and mean for all other omicsData.}

\item{bio_sample_names}{a character string specifying a column in
\code{f_data} which contains names by which to label aggregated samples in
\code{omicsData$e_data} and \code{omicsData$f_data} OR a character vector
with number of elements equal to the number of biological samples.  If a
column name is specified, it should have a one-to-one correspondence with
the technical replicate ID column in \code{f_data}.  Defaults to NULL, in
which case default names are used according to the technical replicate ID
column.}
}
\value{
An object with the same class as omicsData that has been aggregated
  to the biological sample level
}
\description{
For each biomolecule, aggregates the technical replicates within biological
samples using a specified aggregation method
}
\details{
Loss of information after aggregation \tabular{ll}{ f_data: \tab
  If there are columns of f_data that have more than 1 value per biological
  sample, then for each biological sample, only the first value in that
  column will be retained.  Technical replicate specific information will be
  lost.\cr group information:  \tab If a grouping structure has been set
  using a main effect from f_data that has more than 1 level within any given
  biological sample, that grouping structure will be removed.  Call
  \code{group_designation} again on the aggregated data to assign a grouping
  structure. \cr sample names:  \tab Identifiers for each biological sample
  will replace the identifiers for technical replicates as column names in
  e_data as well as the identifier column \code{attr(omicsData,
  'fdata_cname')} in f_data. \cr }
