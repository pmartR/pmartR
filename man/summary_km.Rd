\item{omicsData}{A pmartR data object of any class, which has a `group_df` attribute that is usually created by the `group_designation()` function}

\item{percent}{The percentile}

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(OvarianPepdataBP)
attr(tcga_ovarian_pepdata_bp, "survDF") <- list(t_death = "survival_time", ind_death = "vital_status")
# No percent is provided so the entire object is returned
summary_km(tcga_ovarian_pepdata_bp)

# Percent is provided so corresponding time point is returned
summary_km(tcga_ovarian_pepdata_bp, .4)
}
