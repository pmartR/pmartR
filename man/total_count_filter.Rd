\title{Total Count Filter Object}
\usage{
total_count_filter(omicsData)
}
\arguments{
\item{omicsData}{an object of the class 'seqData', created by
\code{\link{as.seqData}}}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class 'totalcountFilt' (data.frame) that contains the
  molecule identifier and the total count of observed reads for that molecule
  across all samples.
}
\description{
This function returns a totalcountFilt object for use with
\code{\link{applyFilt}}
}
\details{
Filter is based off of recommendations in edgeR processing, where 
the low-observed biomolecules are removed from processing. Default 
recommendation in edgeR is at least 15 total counts observed across samples 
(i.e., if the sum of counts in a row of e_data is < 15, default edgeR 
filtering would remove this biomolecule).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(pmartRdata)
to_filter <- total_count_filter(omicsData = rnaseq_object)
summary(to_filter, min_count = 15)
}
